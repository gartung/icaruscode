# Purpose: Simulation of neutrinos from NuMI on a single ICARUS cryostat.
# Date:    August 19, 2019
# Version: 1.0
#
# GENIE is instructed to use `volDetEnclosure` volume for neutrino interactions.
# This is way larger than it would need to be, and filtering is likely wanted
# after this generation. Also, this generation is going to be quite inefficient
# if LAr interactions are seeked. On the "positive" side, this is the only way
# we know to generate neutrino events in both ICRAUS cryostats.
